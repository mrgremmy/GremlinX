 * Inline signing worker code.
 *
 * This module generates the worker code as a string that can be
 * loaded via Blob URL. The worker uses the bundled @noble/secp256k1
 * library embedded at compile time - no network requests required.
 *
 * SECURITY CRITICAL:
 * - Private keys are zeroed immediately after signing
 * - No key data is logged or stored
 * - Worker only holds key during active signing operation
 * - ECC library is bundled at compile time (no CDN dependency)
